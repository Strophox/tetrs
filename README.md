# tetrs
Tetromino game remake for the console.

# WIP
This is work in progress.

# Notes: How to play
- (If there's a release for your platform available, download it and run it in your favourite terminal emulator.)
- Build yourself with `cargo run`.
- Run in a kitty-protocol-compatible terminal emulator (such as [kitty](<https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/>) itself) for the best gameplay experience.
- Use a command-line flag to change framerate (`cargo run -- --fps=60`)
- Navigate menus with arrow keys, enter and escape.
